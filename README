Use ./win_run.bat <domain> <seed> on Windows laptop. Or
Use ./linux_run.sh <domain> <seed> on Linux systems, or ./build.sh, then ./run.sh

Script ./build.sh and ./run.sh was already provided. I did not extend or contribute to those scripts. Other scripts are extensions
of ./build.sh file.

If ./linux_run.sh or any script fails to run, please double check on VSCode that the formatting is CRLF for Windows systems and LF for
linux systems. If formatting is wrong, then the script files might fail to run. This happened because the project was originally developed on Windows systems.
