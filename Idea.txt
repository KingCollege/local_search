Successor Selector Ideas:
    - Look Ahead
        - The selector will look at the successors and look a few steps a head of time to see if any of their following
        successors will improve overall.
        - Helpfulfilter can be used along with it to prune some successors that are not applicable

Multi Start Local Search (TO DO):
    - Create instances of different search strategies and run them in parallel in order to find a solution
    - Incoperate Multi Start with Iterated Local search which can be used to improve a local search algorithm to
    find a solution or to improve on a solution.
    
Simulated Annealing Search (Implemented)
    - Generate initial solution using EHCS (althought i do plan on using something else)
        - Neighbour generation is based on successors, and closed states (second chance) but only
        the current state gives zero successors, however this will require some experimentation
        - Neighbour selection uses a weak form of Roulette Selection
        - Base Temperature = 1
        - Terminating Temperature = 0.001
        - Alpha = 0.7
        - Iteration per Cool Down = 40
    - Current Perform is significantly better than EHCS, which is expected, unless implementation is wrong.
    - Needs tweaking on parameters to aim for improvements
    - Neighbour selection and generation needs some tweaking.
    - Generated Plan needs to be Validated
